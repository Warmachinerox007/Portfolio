## Featured Projects

### AI Resume Analyzer  
**Tech:** Python, NLP, Streamlit  
Developed an end-to-end resume evaluation tool capable of extracting skills, analyzing structure, and providing job-role matching insights.  
Repository: https://github.com/Warmachinerox007/airesume  

### Smart Crop Protection Using AI  
**Tech:** Python, OpenCV, YOLOv5, TensorFlow, Raspberry Pi  

Developed a real-time vision-based animal detection system designed to prevent crop damage in farmland environments.  
Implemented YOLOv5 for high-accuracy object detection and optimized the inference pipeline to run efficiently on Raspberry Pi hardware.  
The system uses continuous video capture, frame-by-frame detection, and alert logic to notify farmers when animals enter the protected zone.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time detection using YOLOv5 with optimized OpenCV pipeline  
- Edge-device deployment on Raspberry Pi  
- Modular and clean Python code structure  
- Automated alert trigger for detection events  
- Tested across multiple lighting and environmental conditions

### River Waste Detection (Ongoing)  
**Tech:** YOLOv8, Computer Vision  
Working on a vision-based detection system for identifying and reporting plastic waste from a floating platform.
